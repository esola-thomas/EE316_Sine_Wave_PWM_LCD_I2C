# EE316 Junior Lab 2

Design and implement a Pulse Wave Modulator (PWM) to generate sinusoidal waveforms. The system will send a sequence of pulses proportional to the 16-bit samples that reside in the fast asynchronous SRAM of the DE2-115 board. The SRAM is initialized from data stored in a ROM that will be created with a memory initialization file (mif). Create a mif file to represent a 16-bit sinusoidal function with a DC offset that equals the signal's amplitude.
